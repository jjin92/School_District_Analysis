# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Python with Panda

## Challenge

### Recreate the district and school summary DataFrames.
  * Q1: How is the district summary affected?
  - District summary (Previous):
  ![District_summary](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/District_summary.PNG)
  - New chart:
  ![District_summary_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/District_summary_challenge.PNG)
  - After deleting the 9th grade scores, the average math score was lowered slightly. The passing rate for Math and overall also decreased. 
  - We can infer that the 9th grade math score deleted had more above-average scores.
  
  * Q2: How is the school summary affected?
  - School summary (showing last 5 in the list):
  - ![School_summary_tail](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/School_summary_tail.PNG)
  - New chart:
  - ![School_summary_tail_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/School_summary_tail_challenge.PNG)
  - Thomas High School's Average Math score was lowered, while the average reading score was slightly higher. However, the passing rate for both reading and math were significantly lowered.
  
### Recalculate the high- and low-performing schools.
  * Q3: How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?
  - Top 5 performing school
  - ![Top_school](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/Top_school.PNG)
  - New chart
  ![Top_school_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/Top_school_challenge.PNG)
  - Bottom 5 performing school
  - ![Bottom_school](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/Bottom_school.PNG)
  - New chart:
  ![Bottom_school_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/Bottom_school_challenge.PNG)
  - Originally, Thomas High School had a top 2 performance. After the change, the performances is no longer in the top 5. 
    
### Recalculate the scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?
  * Q4: Math and Reading Scores by Grade
  - Math score by grade
  - ![Math_score_by_grade](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/Math_score_by_grade.PNG)
  - New chart:
  ![Math_score_by_grade_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/Math_score_by_grade_challenge.PNG)
  - Reading score by grade
  ![Reading_score_by_grade](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/Reading_score_by_grade.PNG)
  - New chart:
  ![Reading_score_by_grade_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/Reading_score_by_grade_challenge.PNG)
  - The other numbers are unchanged, but the 9th grade score for both reading and math is not availble. 
  
  * Q5: Scores by School Spending
  - Per school spending
  ![per_spending](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/per_spending.PNG)
  - New chart
  ![per_spending_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/per_spending_challenge.PNG)
  - Thomas High School's spending range is between $630-$644. After the change, this group's passing rates droped significantly.
  
  * Q6: Scores by School Size
  - By school size
  ![per_school_size](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/per_school_size.PNG)
  - New chart:
  ![per_school_size_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/per_school_size_challenge.PNG)
  - Thomas High School's size is Medium (1000-2000). As the deleted student's are not counted, the passing rate for this groups has dropped.
  
  * Q7: Scores by School Type
  - Per school type
  ![per_school_type](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/per_school_type.PNG)
  - New chart:
  ![per_school_type_challenge](https://github.com/jjin92/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Image/per_school_type_challenge.PNG)
  - Thomas High School is a Charter school. Replacing the scores lower the passing rates in this group.
